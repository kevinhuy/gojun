Example of a simple app providing a access to "show bgp neighbour" data via NETCONF. 
On startup, it will read it's config and a list of devices. 
After that, it will be waiting for an HTTP GET request to `ip:port/bgpnei` endpoint. 
When it receives a request, it will open concurrent connections to all routers from the list to collect BGP state for each neighbour. 
Then it will transform the data and return it as a JSON object. 
The data received from an API can then be used by a front-end or by any other tool.
